Syllabus-(1)Brief review of the sources of error and local analysis: Relative error, absolute error, and
cancellation; Computer arithmetic; Truncation error; Error propagation and amplification;
Condition number and ill-conditioned problems.

elimination and its variants; LU, QR, Singular value decomposition, Iterative methods for
a linear system, Stationary iterative methods- Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and successive
over-relaxation methods. Non-stationary iterative methods-conjugate gradient (CG),
convergence analysis; preconditioning. Estimation and computation of Â eigenvaluesGershgorin disc, power methods, the QR algorithm
